Starting with a basic HTML page with no styling, creative a responsive website with the following features:

- Full page carousel that shows a random picture upon loading, transitions with a fade animation, automatically generates slider indicators and highlights corresponding indicator with image, and hides slider arrows that appear on hover.
- Top Navigation that stays on top of the page during scrolling, smoothly transitions to smaller nav bar after leaving the carousel section, clicking items on the nav bar smooth scroll to the correct section and highlight the active section
- Formatted each "page" section to change layout according to page size using the Bootstrap 12 column grid.  Added rgba gradients to some sections. 
- Hides extended testimonial blockquotes unless hovered over.
